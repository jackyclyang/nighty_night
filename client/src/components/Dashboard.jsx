              I understand.  Was today a rough day?
              But remember there are great things too.
              No matter how small the joy is,
              they all worth remembering.

              Still a lot of things on your mind?
              Write them down. Get them out.
              Then, you can relax.
              Donâ€™t worry, you can revisit this tomorrow morning.
